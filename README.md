# AutoBusRoutingMAS
AutoBusRoutingMAS is a decentralized multi-agent system for the autonomous and dynamic management of bus routes in a simulated city. Agents —buses, stops, and passengers— communicate and negotiate in real time to adapt to demand and optimize public transport service.

The repository includes:
	•	A baseline version of the system without BDI agents, used as a benchmark for testing.
	•	The full BDI-based model implementation in GAMA.
	•	Required GeoJSON files, images, and other resources needed to run the simulation.
